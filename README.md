## Build emails with React and Styled Components

- `yarn start` to start the dev enviroment
- `yarn build` to compile with Babel and output the static HTML

---

Static HTML is output to the `compiled` folder. Each build creates a new file with a timestamp appended to the name. This behavior can be customized in `./server/createEmail.js`.

Uses a `Condition-padding` button. [Litmus](https://www.litmus.com/blog/a-guide-to-bulletproof-buttons-in-email-design/#coding) for details.
