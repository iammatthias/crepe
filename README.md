## Create-React-Email-Production-Enviroment
### Just call it Crepe

A tailored React toolchain for building email templates that render consistently across devices. Based on [React-Email](https://github.com/lang-ai/react-emails), and heavily modified to fit personal use cases.

Pull requests are welcome.

## Why build emails with React?
Consistency, mostly. Template languages like MJML are great, but they produce too much extra markup.
